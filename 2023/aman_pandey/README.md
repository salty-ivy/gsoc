# Introduction
Hello everyone!! this Aman Pandey also known as **salty-ivy**, third-year computer science and engineering student, have been backend and fullstack developer
in few small startups, stacks of my experience involves django, django-restframework, rails, hotwired-stimulus (thanks to wagtail), neo4j graph databse (cypher query language),
react (rest is given html, css, js...). if you don't find me alive on github you can probably find me on `lichess` and `chess.com` or i would be out playing badminton ;-).
